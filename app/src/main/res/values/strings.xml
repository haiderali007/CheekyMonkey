        <b>What has Cheeky Monkey for Me?</b>\n
Cheeky Monkey helps you create your own price for a drink based on the collective rating of the customers who have rated the drink. Real time demand gives a chance for each drink to have its own pricing. This gives customer total control.\n\n
<b>How does it work for me?</b>\n
It works on the principle of supply and demand. Our Bar Stock Exchange software computes the latest prices through a comprehensive algorithm which instantly updates the prices on the app for the next set of customer to order their drink.\n\n
This level playing field keeps both the customers &amp; the Bar owners on their toes. Not just the owners but the customers compete with each other to rate the best drink.\n\n
<b>Do I ever pay a lower price?</b>\n
Customer truly becomes the king on this platform. Similar to Stock Market their ratings can collectively ensure that market crashes to its lowest. Once that happens they are updated on their phones as well as through a siren in the bar. In this scenario, they should be ready to order their favorite drink and get the benefit of Lower prices. Keep an Eye on the falling prices and reap rich rewards.\n\n
<b>How is Bar Exchange better than Happy Hours?</b>\n
The market opens at 6 PM everyday &amp; customers can order their drink at the Bar or can download the App and order Online. Drinks Menus are displayed on LCDs placed strategically in all sections of the Bar.\n\n
<b>How do I get the winner feeling?</b>\n
Prices start really low at Cheeky Monkey &amp; as the day progresses they begin to dip or pick up based on customer’s ratings. Customers can enjoy the lowest prices at a cost price of the drink. If you show up early and make reservations, you have a greater chance of grabbing your favorite vodka or Beer at amazingly low prices.
